## üìñ Workflow Structure

Workflows are JSON documents that define a series of steps for an LLM to execute:

```json
{
  "name": "Code Review Workflow",
  "description": "Automated code review with actionable feedback",
  "goal": "Perform comprehensive code review",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "inputs": {
    "file_path": {
      "type": "string",
      "description": "Path to code file",
      "required": true
    }
  },
  "steps": [
    {
      "id": 1,
      "action": "tool_call",
      "tool_name": "read_file",
      "parameters": {"path": "{{file_path}}"},
      "save_result_as": "code_content"
    },
    {
      "id": 2,
      "action": "analyze",
      "description": "Analyze code quality",
      "input_from": ["code_content"],
      "save_result_as": "analysis"
    }
  ]
}
```

## üéØ Action Types

### Cognitive Actions
- **analyze**: Examine data and identify patterns
- **consider**: Evaluate options before deciding
- **research**: Gather information from sources
- **validate**: Check conditions or data integrity
- **summarize**: Condense information to key points
- **decide**: Make choices based on criteria
- **extract**: Pull specific information from content
- **compose**: Generate new content

### Control Flow

- **loop**: Iterate over items or conditions
- **parallel**: Execute multiple steps simultaneously
- **wait_for_input**: Pause for user input

### Utility Actions

## üõ†Ô∏è Available Tools

### Workflow Management

1. **create_workflow** - Create a new workflow
   ```json
   {
     "workflow": {
       "name": "My Workflow",
       "description": "What it does",
       "goal": "Desired outcome",
       "steps": [...]
     }
   }
   ```

2. **list_workflows** - List all workflows with filtering
   ```json
   {
     "filter": {
       "tags": ["automation"],
       "name_contains": "review"
     },
     "sort": {
       "field": "created_at",
       "order": "desc"
     }
   }
   ```

3. **get_workflow** - Retrieve a specific workflow
   ```json
   {
     "id": "workflow-uuid"
   }
   ```

4. **update_workflow** - Modify existing workflow
   ```json
   {
     "id": "workflow-uuid",
     "updates": {
       "description": "Updated description"
     },
     "increment_version": true
   }
   ```

5. **delete_workflow** - Soft delete (recoverable)
   ```json
   {
     "id": "workflow-uuid"
   }
   ```

6. **start_workflow** - Start a workflow execution session
   ```json
   {
     "id": "workflow-uuid",
     "inputs": {
       "param1": "value1"
     }
   }
   ```
   Returns execution instructions for the first step and an execution_id.

7. **run_workflow_step** - Execute the next step in the workflow
   ```json
   {
     "execution_id": "execution-uuid",
     "step_result": "result from previous step",
     "next_step_needed": true
   }
   ```
   Call this after completing each step to proceed through the workflow.

8. **get_workflow_versions** - List all available versions of a workflow
   ```json
   {
     "workflow_id": "workflow-uuid"
   }
   ```
   Returns list of all saved versions for version history tracking.

9. **rollback_workflow** - Rollback a workflow to a previous version
   ```json
   {
     "workflow_id": "workflow-uuid",
     "target_version": "1.0.0",
     "reason": "Reverting breaking changes"
   }
   ```
   Restores a previous version as the active workflow.

## üîÑ Step-by-Step Execution

The workflow system supports interactive, step-by-step execution similar to the sequential thinking tool:

1. **Start a workflow** with `start_workflow` - returns the first step instructions
2. **Execute the step** following the provided instructions  
3. **Continue to next step** with `run_workflow_step`, passing:
   - The `execution_id` from start_workflow
   - Any `step_result` from the current step
   - `next_step_needed: true` to continue (or false to end early)
4. **Repeat** until the workflow completes

Each step provides:
- Clear instructions for what to do
- Current variable state
- Expected output format
- Next step guidance

### Template Variables

The workflow system supports template variable substitution using `{{variable}}` syntax:

- **In parameters**: `"path": "output_{{format}}.txt"` ‚Üí `"path": "output_csv.txt"`
- **In descriptions**: `"Processing {{count}} records"` ‚Üí `"Processing 100 records"`
- **In prompts**: `"Enter value for {{field}}"` ‚Üí `"Enter value for email"`
- **In transformations**: Variables are automatically substituted

Template variables are resolved from the current workflow session variables, including:
- Initial inputs provided to `start_workflow`
- Results saved from previous steps via `save_result_as`
- Any variables set during workflow execution

## üéØ Dependency Management & Performance Optimization

The workflow system includes advanced features to minimize token usage and improve performance for complex workflows:

### Dependency-Based Variable Filtering

Control which variables are visible to each step to dramatically reduce context size:

```json
{
  "name": "Optimized Workflow",
  "strict_dependencies": true,  // Enable strict mode
  "steps": [
    {
      "id": 1,
      "action": "tool_call",
      "tool_name": "read_large_file",
      "save_result_as": "large_data"
    },
    {
      "id": 2,
      "action": "analyze",
      "input_from": ["large_data"],
      "save_result_as": "summary",
      "dependencies": []  // In strict mode, sees NO previous variables
    },
    {
      "id": 3,
      "action": "compose",
      "dependencies": [2],  // Only sees 'summary' from step 2
      "save_result_as": "report"
    },
    {
      "id": 4,
      "action": "validate",
      "show_all_variables": true,  // Override to see everything
      "save_result_as": "validation"
    }
  ]
}
```

### Workflow-Level Settings

- **`strict_dependencies`** (boolean, default: false)
  - `false`: Steps without dependencies see all variables (backward compatible)
  - `true`: Steps without dependencies see NO variables (must explicitly declare)

### Step-Level Settings

- **`dependencies`** (array of step IDs)
  - Lists which previous steps' outputs this step needs
  - Step only sees outputs from listed steps plus workflow inputs
  - Empty array in strict mode means NO variables visible

- **`show_all_variables`** (boolean)
  - Override for specific steps that need full visibility
  - Useful for validation or debugging steps

### Performance Features

1. **Differential State Updates**: Only shows variables that changed
   - `+ variable_name`: Newly added variables
   - `~ variable_name`: Modified variables
   - Unchanged variables are not displayed

2. **Progressive Step Loading**: Only shows next 3 upcoming steps
   - Reduces context for long workflows
   - Shows "... and X more steps" for remaining

3. **Selective Variable Display**: Based on dependencies
   - Dramatically reduces tokens for workflows with verbose outputs
   - Maintains full state internally for branching/retry

### Best Practices for Token Optimization

1. **Use `strict_dependencies: true`** for workflows with large intermediate outputs
2. **Explicitly declare dependencies** to minimize variable visibility
3. **Place verbose outputs early** in the workflow and filter them out in later steps
4. **Use meaningful variable names** to make dependencies clear
5. **Group related steps** to minimize cross-dependencies

### Example: Data Processing with Filtering

```json
{
  "name": "Large Data Processing",
  "strict_dependencies": true,
  "inputs": {
    "file_path": { "type": "string", "required": true }
  },
  "steps": [
    {
      "id": 1,
      "action": "tool_call",
      "tool_name": "read_csv",
      "parameters": { "path": "{{file_path}}" },
      "save_result_as": "raw_data"
    },
    {
      "id": 2,
      "action": "transform",
      "transformation": "Extract key metrics only",
      "dependencies": [1],  // Only sees raw_data
      "save_result_as": "metrics"
    },
    {
      "id": 3,
      "action": "analyze",
      "criteria": "Identify trends and anomalies",
      "dependencies": [2],  // Only sees metrics, not raw_data
      "save_result_as": "analysis"
    },
    {
      "id": 4,
      "action": "compose",
      "criteria": "Create executive summary",
      "dependencies": [2, 3],  // Sees metrics and analysis only
      "save_result_as": "report"
    }
  ]
}
```

In this example:
- Step 2 processes large raw data but only outputs key metrics
- Step 3 analyzes metrics without seeing the large raw data
- Step 4 creates a report from metrics and analysis only
- Token usage is minimized by filtering out verbose intermediate data

## üìö Example Workflows

### Code Review Workflow
Analyzes code quality, identifies issues, and provides improvement suggestions.
- Sample data: `/workflows/examples/sample-data/sample-code-for-review.js`

### Data Processing Pipeline
ETL workflow with validation, quality checks, and conditional branching.
- Sample data: `/workflows/examples/sample-data/sample-data.csv`

### Research Assistant

See the `/workflows/examples` directory for complete workflow definitions.

## üìÅ Manual Workflow Import

You can manually add workflows by placing JSON files in the imports directory:

1. Navigate to `~/.workflows-mcp/imports/`
2. Place your workflow JSON files there (any filename ending in `.json`)
3. Start or restart the MCP server
4. The workflows will be automatically imported with:
   - A new UUID assigned if missing or invalid
   - Metadata created if not present
   - Original files moved to `imports/processed/` after successful import

Example workflow file structure:
```json
{
  "name": "My Custom Workflow",
  "description": "A manually created workflow",
  "goal": "Accomplish something specific",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "steps": [
    {
      "id": 1,
      "action": "tool_call",
      "description": "First step",
      "tool_name": "example_tool",
      "parameters": {}
    }
  ]
}
```
